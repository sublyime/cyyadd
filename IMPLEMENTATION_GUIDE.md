# Implementation Guide - All Fixes Applied

This guide shows all the fixes and improvements that have been implemented.

## Backend Changes

### 1. New CORS Configuration
**File**: `java-backend/src/main/java/com/example/refactoredbackend/config/WebConfig.java`

- Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for frontend requests
- Allows requests from `localhost:3000`
- Configured for development; update for production

### 2. Updated Models with Relationships

#### Event Model (`Event.java`)
- Added `@ManyToOne` relationship to Chemical
- Added `@JoinColumn(name = "chemical_id")`
- Added auto-generated ID with `@GeneratedValue`
- Added default timestamp
- Uses `FetchType.EAGER` for immediate chemical loading

#### Station Model (`Station.java`)
- Renamed fields to match frontend: `latitude` → `lat`, `longitude` → `lon`
- Changed ID to auto-generated Long
- Added `provider` field for weather data source

#### Chemical Model (`Chemical.java`)
- Added auto-generated ID
- Added constructors for easier instantiation
- Added `molecularWeight` and `cas` fields for future expansion

### 3. New Service Classes

#### DispersionService.java
Implements three atmospheric dispersion models:

- **Gaussian Plume Model**: For continuous releases
  - Formula: `C(x,y,z) = (Q / (2πuσyσz)) * exp(-y²/(2σy²)) * [exp(-(z-H)²/(2σz²)) + exp(-(z+H)²/(2σz²))]`
  - Includes reflective boundary condition at ground level
  - Converts results to µg/m³

- **Puff Model**: For puff/slug releases with time decay
  - Includes time-dependent sigma growth
  - Accounts for plume drift downwind
  - Similar Gaussian formulation with temporal component

- **Instantaneous Release Model**: For sudden releases
  - Uses Pasquill-Gifford stability classes (A-F)
  - Implements stability-dependent dispersion parameters
  - Suitable for accidental release scenarios

All models include input validation and safety bounds.

#### WeatherService.java
- `storeWeatherData()`: Persists weather observations to database
- `getLatestWeather()`: Retrieves most recent weather data
- `getWeatherFromOpenMeteo()`: Simulated API call (implement real integration)
- `getWeatherFromNOAA()`: Simulated API call (implement real integration)

#### DataService.java
Enhanced with:
- Station CRUD operations
- Event creation and deletion with auto-timestamping
- Chemical management
- All with proper error handling

### 4. Updated DataController
**File**: `DataController.java`

New endpoints implemented:

**Stations**:
- `GET /api/stations` - List all stations
- `POST /api/stations` - Create station (query params)
- `DELETE /api/stations/{id}` - Delete station

- `GET /api/events` - List all events
- `POST /api/events` - Create event (JSON body with chemical relationship)
- `DELETE /api/events/{id}` - Delete event
- `GET /api/events/{id}` - Get single event

**Chemicals**:
- `GET /api/chemicals` - List all chemicals
- `POST /api/chemicals` - Create chemical
- `DELETE /api/chemicals/{id}` - Delete chemical

**Dispersion Models**:
- `POST /api/model/plume` - Calculate plume concentration
- `POST /api/model/puff` - Calculate puff concentration
- `POST /api/model/instantaneous` - Calculate instantaneous release

**Weather**:
- `GET /api/weather/latest` - Get latest weather data
- `POST /api/weather/store` - Store weather observation
- `GET /api/weather/open-meteo` - Fetch from Open-Meteo (lat, lon params)
- `GET /api/weather/noaa` - Fetch from NOAA (lat, lon params)

**Health Check**:
- `GET /api/health` - Service status

### 5. Application Properties Updated
**File**: `application.properties`

- Port set to 8080 (corrected from default)
- H2 database configured for development
- Logging levels configured
- Application name and version added

- Added progress tracking for user feedback

### 3. Enhanced WeatherPanel.js
**Improvements:**
- Fixed API port and endpoints

- Type conversion for numeric display

### 4. Enhanced EventList.js
**Major Improvements:**

## Database Model Fixes

### Relationships
**Event ↔ Chemical**: Many-to-One relationship
- Each event references exactly one chemical
- Chemical can have multiple events
- Eager loading ensures chemical data is available

### Naming Consistency
- Station: `latitude` & `longitude` → `lat` & `lon`
- Event: Direct field access with proper types
- All timestamps use `LocalDateTime`

## Running the Application

### Step 1: Backend Setup
```bash
cd java-backend
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
# Backend runs on http://localhost:8080
```

### Step 2: Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
# Create .env file from template
cp .env.example .env

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
# Frontend runs on http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 3: Testing
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Go to Weather tab → Add Station
3. Add a station and fetch weather data
4. Go to Events tab → Create Release Event

## Troubleshooting

### Frontend can't connect to backend
- Ensure backend is running on port 8080
- Check CORS configuration in WebConfig.java
- Verify `REACT_APP_API_URL` in .env file

### "Cannot find module 'leaflet'" error
- Run `npm install` in frontend directory
- Clear node_modules and reinstall if issues persist

### Database errors
- H2 database is in-memory; data is lost on restart
- For persistent data, switch to PostgreSQL

### Model calculation returns 0
- Check input parameters for validity
- Wind speed must be > 0
- Distance x must be > 0
- Ensure sigma values are reasonable
